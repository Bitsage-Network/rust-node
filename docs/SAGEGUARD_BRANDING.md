## SageGuard Positioning

### Core Message

> "SageGuard protects the integrity of decentralized computation through Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus."

### One-Line Description

**Technical:** "Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus protocol for validating Stwo proofs in the BitSage Network."

**Marketing:** "SageGuard: Byzantine consensus securing decentralized compute on Starknet."

---

## Usage Guidelines

### Correct Usage ✅

1. **When discussing the consensus mechanism:**
   - "BitSage uses **SageGuard consensus** to validate proofs"
   - "Validators participate in **SageGuard** by staking SAGE tokens"
   - "**SageGuard** achieves finality in 30 seconds with 67% quorum"

2. **In technical documentation:**
   - "The **SageGuard consensus protocol** ensures Byzantine fault tolerance"
   - "**SageGuard** validators vote using ECDSA signatures"
   - "Proof validity is determined through **SageGuard** consensus"

3. **In code:**
   ```rust
   use bitsage_node::SageGuardConsensus;

   let consensus = SageGuardConsensus::new(
       validator_address,
       signing_key,
       stake_amount,
       config,
   );
   ```

### Incorrect Usage ❌

1. **Don't use as standalone product:**
   - ❌ "Download SageGuard" (it's part of BitSage Network)
   - ✅ "BitSage Network uses SageGuard consensus"

2. **Don't confuse with other components:**
   - ❌ "SageGuard generates proofs" (that's Obelysk/Stwo)
   - ✅ "SageGuard validates proofs generated by Obelysk"

3. **Don't add redundant descriptors:**
   - ❌ "SageGuard BFT consensus protocol" (redundant - SageGuard IS BFT)
   - ✅ "SageGuard consensus" or "SageGuard protocol"

## Key Differentiators

### vs Other Consensus Protocols

| Protocol | Network | Type | Differentiator |
|----------|---------|------|----------------|
| **Tendermint** | Cosmos | BFT | General-purpose blockchain consensus |
| **HotStuff** | Aptos | BFT | High-throughput with pipelining |
| **Casper FFG** | Ethereum | PoS | Finality gadget for PoW→PoS |
| **SageGuard** | BitSage | BFT | **Proof validation consensus for DePIN** |

**Key differentiation:** SageGuard is purpose-built for validating ZK proofs in decentralized compute networks, not general transaction ordering.

### Unique Features

1. ✅ **Proof-Specific**: Designed for STARK proof validation, not generic transactions
2. ✅ **ECDSA Signatures**: P-256 curve matching TEE attestation standards
3. ✅ **Stake-Weighted**: SAGE token staking determines voting power
4. ✅ **Multi-Chain Ready**: Chain-agnostic design (currently Starknet)
5. ✅ **Hybrid Security**: Combines cryptographic proofs + consensus voting

```
BitSage Network Launches SageGuard Consensus for Decentralized Compute Validation

[CITY, DATE] - BitSage Network today announced the launch of SageGuard, a
Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus protocol designed specifically for
validating zero-knowledge proofs in decentralized compute networks.

SageGuard enables validators to stake SAGE tokens and vote on proof validity,
achieving cryptographic agreement with 67% quorum requirements and 30-second
finality. The protocol leverages ECDSA P-256 signatures for vote authentication
and integrates with Starknet L2 for on-chain settlement.

"SageGuard represents a new paradigm in decentralized infrastructure," said
[NAME], [TITLE] at BitSage Network. "By purpose-building consensus for proof
validation rather than transaction ordering, we achieve both security and
efficiency for DePIN applications."

Key features of SageGuard include:
- Byzantine fault tolerance with 67% quorum
- ECDSA signature verification for validator votes
- Stake-weighted voting using SAGE tokens
- Integration with Starknet L2 settlement
- 30-second consensus finality

SageGuard is now live on BitSage Network testnet, with mainnet launch planned
for [DATE]. Validators can begin staking SAGE tokens at [URL].

About BitSage Network:
BitSage is a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) bringing
scalable, privacy-preserving compute to Starknet through zero-knowledge proofs.

# Introducing SageGuard: Byzantine Consensus for Decentralized Compute

Today we're excited to announce **SageGuard**, the Byzantine Fault Tolerant
consensus protocol powering validator coordination in the BitSage Network.

## Why SageGuard?

Traditional blockchain consensus focuses on ordering transactions. SageGuard
takes a different approach: validating zero-knowledge proofs in a trustless,
decentralized manner.

## FAQ

### Q: Is SageGuard a blockchain?
**A:** No. SageGuard is a consensus protocol used by BitSage Network validators to agree on proof validity. The blockchain settlement happens on Starknet L2.

### Q: How is SageGuard different from Tendermint?
**A:** While both are BFT protocols, SageGuard is purpose-built for validating ZK proofs in DePIN networks, not general transaction ordering. It integrates directly with Stwo proof verification and Starknet settlement.

### Q: Can SageGuard work on chains other than Starknet?
**A:** Yes. SageGuard is chain-agnostic by design. While currently integrated with Starknet, the consensus layer can validate proofs for any settlement layer.

### Q: What's the relationship between SageGuard and SAGE token?
**A:** Validators stake SAGE tokens to participate in SageGuard consensus. Voting power is proportional to stake amount, creating economic security.

### Q: Is SageGuard open source?
**A:** Yes. SageGuard is open source under Apache 2.0 license as part of the BitSage Network codebase.
